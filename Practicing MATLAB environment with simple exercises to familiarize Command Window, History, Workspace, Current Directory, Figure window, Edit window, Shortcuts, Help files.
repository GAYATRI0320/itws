Basic Scalar & Vector Operations
Creation of Scalar Elements
Y = [1 4 6] Declares a row vetor
yT = [1; 4; 6] Declares a Column vector
Creation of Vector Elements
Y = [1 4 6; 2 7 3; 4 1 1]
Creates a 3*3 matrix

To determine the size / order of the vectors.

Size(y)

To change the elements in the given vector

vector(i,j) = value

Performing element by element operations using dot operator

.*, ./, .^,

6

Linspace[a,b,N] Vector can be created by evenly spaced points. From a to
b the vector is created by ‘N’ evenly spaced points
Eg: linspace[0,1,5] 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

Transpose of a matrix – y’
ans =

1. 2. 4.
4. 7. 1.
6. 3. 1.
